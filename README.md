# AI/ML Demo Repository

This repository is a collection of various AI/ML projects and demonstrations that I've created to showcase my skills and learnings in the field. Each sub-folder within this repository represents a distinct project with its own unique focus and set of technologies.

## Projects

Below is a list of the projects currently available in this repository:

*   **[Queryable Doc](./queryable_doc/README.md):** A tool to chat with your documents. This is a demo application that showcases a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain, OpenAI, and ChromaDB. It allows you to upload your documents and ask questions about their content. The application is built with Streamlit.
*   **[Vulnerability Search](./vulnerability_search/README.md):** A tool to search for vulnerabilities. This project is a semantic search engine for a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) database. It uses a Streamlit web interface to provide a user-friendly way to search for vulnerabilities using natural language.

Each project folder contains a detailed `README.md` file with specific instructions on how to set up and run the application. Please refer to the individual project's `README.md` for more information.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to serve as a living portfolio of my work in AI and Machine Learning. It's a place where I can experiment with new ideas, implement interesting concepts, and demonstrate my ability to build practical applications using AI.

I believe in learning by doing, and these projects are a direct result of that philosophy. They range from simple scripts to more complex applications, and each one has taught me valuable lessons about different aspects of AI/ML.

Thank you for visiting my repository!
