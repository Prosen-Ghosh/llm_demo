**Headline:** From Chatbot to Agent: Letting AI Take the Wheel 🚀

**Post Content:**

Rule-based chatbots are a thing of the past. If the user says "calculate," run the math function. If they say "search," run the search function. This approach is brittle and doesn't scale.

I'm excited to share a project from my AI engineering journey: a "Tool-Calling Agent" that uses AI to decide which tool to use.

I gave the AI two tools: a calculator and a web searcher. When I ask, "What is 25 * 4?", the agent intelligently selects the calculator and returns the answer. No hard-coded `if/else` statements, just the power of AI.

This is a move from "Chatbots that talk" to "Agents that do."
