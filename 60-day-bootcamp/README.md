This directory contains projects developed during a 60-day bootcamp, showcasing various AI/ML concepts and their practical applications.

## Day 1 Projects

*   **[Async LLM Orchestrator](./day-1/async_llm_orchestrator/README.md):** A service designed to orchestrate asynchronous calls to various Large Language Models (LLMs). It handles model routing, response aggregation, and provides a unified interface for interacting with different LLM providers.
*   **[Profile Enricher](./day-1/profile-enricher/README.md):** A FastAPI-based microservice that takes a user's profile, validates it, and enriches it with additional information from an external service.

## Day 2 Projects

*   **[LLM Proxy](./day-2/llm-proxy/README.md):** A proxy service for Large Language Models (LLMs). This project is designed to act as an intermediary between client applications and various LLM providers, offering features like request routing, load balancing, and potentially caching or API key management.

Each project within the day-specific folders has its own `README.md` with detailed setup and usage instructions.
