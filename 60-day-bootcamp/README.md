# 60-Day Bootcamp

This directory contains projects developed during a 60-day bootcamp, showcasing various AI/ML concepts and their practical applications.

## Day 1 Projects

*   **[Async LLM Orchestrator](./day-1/async_llm_orchestrator/README.md):** A service designed to orchestrate asynchronous calls to various Large Language Models (LLMs). It handles model routing, response aggregation, and provides a unified interface for interacting with different LLM providers.
*   **[Profile Enricher](./day-1/profile-enricher/README.md):** A FastAPI-based microservice that takes a user's profile, validates it, and enriches it with additional information from an external service.

## Day 2 Projects

*   **[Streaming LLM API](./day-2/streaming-llm-api/README.md):** A production-grade RESTful API for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) with a focus on streaming responses, modular provider integration, and robust architecture.

## Day 3 Projects

*   **[Function Calling Demo](./day-3/function-calling-demo/README.md):** A FastAPI-based application that demonstrates an enterprise-grade function calling system using a Large Language Model (LLM).

## Day 4 Projects

*   **[Invoice Extraction Demo](./day-4/invoice-extraction-demo/README.md):** An enterprise-grade solution for extracting structured data from unstructured invoice text using Large Language Models (LLMs).

Each project within the day-specific folders has its own `README.md` with detailed setup and usage instructions.
